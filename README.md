# Text-based Robotic Navigation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs)

This repository serves as the official project landing page and documentation hub for our Final Year Project (FYP) at the **Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
Our research focuses on the development and evaluation of resource-efficient robotic navigation systems. By leveraging **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, specifically the **NaVILA** architecture, we aim to enable robots to navigate complex environments based on natural language instructions. 

Our goal is to optimize these models for accessibility and resilience in low-bandwidth and energy-scarce environments, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios.
